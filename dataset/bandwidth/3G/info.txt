Format:
The logs have the following format:
1289406399 549692 59.851754 10.781778 248069 1008
1289406400 550772 59.851864 10.781833 191698 1080
1289406401 551773 59.851964 10.781901 280579 1001
1289406402 552893 59.85206  10.781969 248971 1120
Here, the different columns have the following meaning:
Unix timestamps (number of seconds since 1970-01-01) are given by column 1.
A monotonically increasing timestamp in milliseconds since some unspecified startingpoint is given by column 2
GPS positions are given by column 3 and 4. The latitude in decimal degrees is given by column 3 and the longitude in decimal degrees is given by column 4.
Column 5 contains the number of bytes received since the previous measurement (the above line).
Column 6 contains the number of milliseconds elapsed since the previous measurement (the above line). This is actualy the difference between the values in column 2 for this and the previous line.
This means that for example to get kilobytes per second for a specific sample, divide column 5 by column 6.
